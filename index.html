                            <p>I am a native of Atlanta, Georgia.  I have a B.S. in Financial Management from Clemson University and an MBA from Arizona State University.  I enjoy spending my free time visiting friends and family, watching sports, working out, and occasionally officiating a wedding.  My passion for technology and prior professional experience has led me to the Georgia Tech Bootcamp for full stack web development based on its prior success and formidable reputation.</p>

                                <p>Atlanta has become a technological playground for a number of large companies, both domestic and international.  My goal after completing the bootcamp is to connect with key stakeholders within those companies seeking coding talent.  Specifically, I will seek to learn how these companies utilize their developers to make a profit and how I can contribute in that forum.  I would also like to explore the long-term career paths that exist after beginning in a developer role with a company.  Contacts I have made in the field of coding thus far have emphasized a need for individuals that can understand the principals and theoretical approach to software development and translate the feasibiltiy of project accomplishment to Senior Management.  Conversely, those same individuals expressed a desire to understand the needs of Senior Management as it relates to increasing profits with respect to internal and external programming deliverables.  I believe my professional experience can provide assistance in bridging that gap within a company after completion of this bootcamp.</p>
